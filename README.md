# abtop

**Like [btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop), but for your AI coding agents.**

See every Claude Code, Codex CLI, and OpenCode session at a glance — token usage, context window %, rate limits, child processes, open ports, and more.
Claude Code, Codex CLI, and OpenCode sessions are discovered from local process/file state, so multiple active profiles are supported across macOS, Linux, and Windows.

![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graykode/abtop/main/assets/demo.gif)

## Why

- Running 3+ agents across projects? See them all in one screen.
- Hitting rate limits? Watch your quota in real-time.
- Agent spawned a server and forgot to kill it? Orphan port detection.
- Context window filling up? Per-session % bars with warnings.

All read-only. No API keys. No auth.

## Install

### macOS / Linux

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/graykode/abtop/releases/latest/download/abtop-installer.sh | sh
```

### Cargo

```bash
cargo install abtop
```

### Windows

Native support — no WSL required. Uses `sysinfo` for process info and `netstat -ano` for listening ports.

```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://github.com/graykode/abtop/releases/latest/download/abtop-installer.ps1 | iex"
```

Or `cargo install abtop` from any terminal with Git in PATH. Claude Code config is resolved automatically from `%USERPROFILE%\.claude`.

### Other

Pre-built binaries for all platforms are available on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/graykode/abtop/releases) page.

## Usage

```bash
abtop                    # Launch TUI
abtop --once             # Print snapshot and exit
abtop --json             # Print one JSON snapshot and exit (for scripts/tools)
abtop --setup            # Install rate limit collection hook
abtop --theme dracula    # Launch with a specific theme
```

Recommended terminal size: **120x40** or larger. Minimum 80x24 — panels hide gracefully when small.

### tmux

abtop works standalone, but running inside tmux unlocks session jumping — press `Enter` to switch directly to the pane running that agent.

```bash
tmux new -s work
# pane 0: abtop
# pane 1: claude (project A)
# pane 2: claude (project B)
# → Enter on a session in abtop jumps to its pane
```

OpenCode support reads the local SQLite database at `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` and requires `sqlite3` in `PATH`.

## Themes

12 built-in themes, including 4 colorblind-friendly options (`high-contrast`, `protanopia`, `deuteranopia`, `tritanopia`). Press `t` to cycle at runtime, or launch with `--theme <name>`. Your choice is saved to `~/.config/abtop/config.toml`.

## Configuration

`~/.config/abtop/config.toml` supports:

```toml
theme = "btop"
# Hide specific agent CLIs from the TUI (case-insensitive).
# Useful if you only use one agent and want a cleaner view.
hidden_agents = ["codex"]
# Additional Claude Code profile roots to scan.
# abtop also auto-discovers ~/.claude and ~/.claude-* roots that contain
# both sessions/ and projects/.
claude_config_dirs = ["~/.claude-personal", "~/.claude-work-team"]
# UI language. Omit or leave empty to auto-detect from LANG.
language = "zh"
```

### Supported Languages

| Code | Language            |
| ---- | ------------------- |
| `en` | English (default)   |
| `zh` | Simplified Chinese  |

When `language` is unset, abtop auto-detects from `LANG` — any value starting with `zh` switches to Simplified Chinese, otherwise English.

## iPhone / Compact Mode

When the terminal width is below 60 columns, abtop automatically switches to a single-page iPhone-style layout that fits narrow screens (e.g. iPhone with Termux, split tmux panes, small SSH windows). Heights ≥ 18 rows are supported.

The compact view packs everything onto one screen:

- **Meta row** — CPU/GPU/power, top status bar
- **mmx · quota** — 5h and 7d buckets, each with a native `■` bar and a reset countdown (`in 2h 13m`). The bar color follows the `used` share via the CPU gradient; the numeric duration in the countdown is independently graded by its own remaining share of the bucket, so the urgency scales with how soon the reset lands.
- **sessions** — up to 5 sessions, each rendered as a 3-row block:
  - Row 1: `►CC <project>      ●<status>  <pct>% <model>` — status, context % and shortened model name are right-aligned, with the gap between project name and the status cluster auto-filled.
  - Row 2: `Summary: …` — auto-generated session summary
  - Row 3: `└─ <task>           <age>/<N>T/<tokens>` — current task and compact stats
- **tokens** — per-session token usage (total, in, out, cache) with native `■` bars in the same color scheme as the desktop panel.
- **chat** — last few messages from the selected session, bottom-pinned
- **footer** — compact keybind hints

Model names are auto-shortened to keep the right edge aligned: `MiniMax-M2.7-Highspeed` becomes `M2.7-hs`, `claude-opus-4-6` becomes `opus4.6`, `claude-sonnet-4-6[1m]` becomes `sonnet4.6[1m]`. The right-alignment width is computed from the longest shortened name currently visible, so the model-name column stays aligned as sessions come and go.

## Library / JSON snapshot

abtop is also a library crate, so local tools can reuse its data-collection
layer in-process — no re-scanning, no subprocesses — and serialize the same
state the TUI renders.

```bash
abtop --json    # one-shot JSON snapshot for scripts
```

For long-running consumers, build an `App`, refresh it with
`App::tick_no_summaries()` (which never spawns `claude --print`, so it doesn't
touch your Claude quota), and call `App::to_snapshot(interval_ms)` to get a
JSON-serializable [`Snapshot`]:

```rust,no_run
use abtop::app::App;
use abtop::{config, theme::Theme};

let cfg = config::load_config();
let mut app = App::new_with_config_and_claude_dirs(
    Theme::default(), &cfg.hidden_agents, cfg.panels, &cfg.claude_config_dirs,
);
app.tick_no_summaries();
let json = serde_json::to_string(&app.to_snapshot(2_000)).unwrap();
```

`App` is not `Send` (it owns the collectors), so keep it on one thread and pass
the serialized JSON elsewhere. [abtop-web-ui](https://github.com/XKHoshizora/abtop-web-ui)
is a reference consumer: a local-first web dashboard built on exactly this API.

## Privacy

abtop reads local files and local process/open-file metadata only. No API keys, no auth. In the TUI and `--once` output, tool names and file paths are shown, but file contents and prompt text are never displayed. Session summaries are generated via `claude --print`, which makes its own API call — this is the only indirect network usage.

The JSON snapshot includes richer local dashboard data, including `summary`, `chat_messages`, working directories, config roots, tool-call previews, child process commands, token counts, and port metadata. Chat text is bounded and redacted by the collectors, but it is still derived from local transcripts and may contain sensitive project context. Treat JSON snapshots as local/private data and avoid writing them to shared logs or exposing them on a network without your own access controls.

## Acknowledgements

Huge thanks to [@tbouquet](https://github.com/tbouquet) for driving much of abtop's recent shape — themes, config overlay and panel toggles, session filtering, subagent tree view, the context window gauge with compaction detection, plus a steady stream of fixes and security hardening along the way.
